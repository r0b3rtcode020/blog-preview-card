## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to implement responsive typography without the need to use media queries. In the end, I ended up learning something that until this moment I didn't know existed.

```html
<h3 class="card__title">HTML & CSS foundations</h3>
```

```css
.card__title {
  font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 3vw, 1.5rem);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning and improving in the following areas:

- Advanced CSS techniques for responsive designs.
